        ## Troubleshoot
        If Playwright is not behaving the way you expect, we'd ask you to look at the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and search the issue tracker for evidence supporting your expectation.
        Please make reasonable efforts to troubleshoot and rule out issues with your code, the configuration, or any 3rd party libraries you might be using.
        Playwright offers [several debugging tools](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug) that you can use to troubleshoot your issues.

        ## Ask for help through appropriate channels
        If you feel unsure about the cause of the problem, consider asking for help on for example [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) or our [Discord channel](https://aka.ms/playwright/discord) before posting a bug report. The issue tracker is not a help forum.

        ## Make a minimal reproduction
        To file the report, you will need a GitHub repository with a minimal (but complete) example and simple/clear steps on how to reproduce the bug.
        The simpler you can make it, the more likely we are to successfully verify and fix the bug. You can create a new project with `npm init playwright@latest new-project` and then add the test code there.
        Please make sure you only include the code and the dependencies absolutely necessary for your repro. Due to the security considerations, we can only run the code we trust. Major web frameworks are Ok to use, but smaller convenience libraries are not.
