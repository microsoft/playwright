## Introduction

Here are the most common options available in the command line.

- Run all the tests
  ```bash
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Run a single test file
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/todo-page.spec.ts
  ```

- Run a set of test files
  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/
  ```

- Run files that have `my-spec` or `my-spec-2` in the file name
  ```bash
  npx playwright test my-spec my-spec-2
  ```

- Run tests that are in line 42 in my-spec.ts
  ```bash
  npx playwright test my-spec.ts:42
  ```

- Run the test with the title
  ```bash
  npx playwright test -g "add a todo item"
  ```

- Run tests in headed browsers
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --headed
  ```

- Run all the tests against a specific project
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --project=chromium
  ```

- Disable [parallelization](./test-parallel.md)
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --workers=1
  ```

- Choose a [reporter](./test-reporters.md)
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --reporter=dot
  ```

- Run in debug mode with [Playwright Inspector](./debug.md)
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --debug
  ```

- Run tests in interactive UI mode, with a built-in watch mode (Preview)
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --ui
  ```

- Ask for help
  ```bash
  npx playwright test --help
  ```

## Reference

Complete set of Playwright Test options is available in the [configuration file](./test-use-options.md). Following options can be passed to a command line and take priority over the configuration file:

| Option | Description |
| :- | :- |
| Non-option arguments | Each argument is treated as a regular expression matched against the full test file path. Only tests from the files matching the pattern will be executed. Special symbols like `$` or `*` should be escaped with `\`. In many shells/terminals you may need to quote the arguments. |
| `-c <file>` or `--config <file>`| Configuration file. If not passed, defaults to `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` in the current directory. |
| `--debug`| Run tests with Playwright Inspector. Shortcut for `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable and `--timeout=0 --max-failures=1 --headed --workers=1` options.|
| `--fail-on-flaky-tests` | Fails test runs that contain flaky tests. By default flaky tests count as successes. |
| `--forbid-only` | Whether to disallow `test.only`. Useful on CI.|
| `--global-timeout <number>` | Total timeout for the whole test run in milliseconds. By default, there is no global timeout. Learn more about [various timeouts](./test-timeouts.md).|
| `-g <grep>` or `--grep <grep>` | Only run tests matching this regular expression. For example, this will run `'should add to cart'` when passed `-g "add to cart"`.  The regular expression will be tested against the string that consists of the project name, test file name, `test.describe` titles if any, test title and all test tags, separated by spaces, e.g. `chromium my-test.spec.ts my-suite my-test @smoke`. The filter does not apply to the tests from dependency projects, i.e. Playwright will still run all tests from [project dependencies](./test-projects.md#dependencies). |
| `--grep-invert <grep>` | Only run tests **not** matching this regular expression. The opposite of `--grep`. The filter does not apply to the tests from dependency projects, i.e. Playwright will still run all tests from [project dependencies](./test-projects.md#dependencies).|
| `--headed` | Run tests in headed browsers. Useful for debugging. |
| `--ignore-snapshots` | Whether to ignore [snapshots](./test-snapshots.md). Use this when snapshot expectations are known to be different, e.g. running tests on Linux against Windows screenshots. |
| `--last-failed` | Only re-run the failures.|
| `--list` | list all the tests, but do not run them.|
| `--max-failures <N>` or `-x`| Stop after the first `N` test failures. Passing `-x` stops after the first failure.|
| `--no-deps` | Ignore the dependencies between projects and behave as if they were not specified. |
| `--output <dir>` | Directory for artifacts produced by tests, defaults to `test-results`. |
| `--only-changed [ref]` | Only run test files that have been changed between working tree and "ref". Defaults to running all uncommitted changes with ref=HEAD. Only supports Git. |
| `--pass-with-no-tests` | Allows the test suite to pass when no files are found. |
| `--project <name>` | Only run tests from the specified [projects](./test-projects.md), supports '*' wildcard. Defaults to running all projects defined in the configuration file.|
| `--quiet` | Whether to suppress stdout and stderr from the tests. |
| `--repeat-each <N>` | Run each test `N` times, defaults to one. |
| `--reporter <reporter>` | Choose a reporter: minimalist `dot`, concise `line` or detailed `list`. See [reporters](./test-reporters.md) for more information. You can also pass a path to a [custom reporter](./test-reporters.md#custom-reporters) file. |
| `--retries <number>` | The maximum number of [retries](./test-retries.md#retries) for flaky tests, defaults to zero (no retries). |
| `--shard <shard>` | [Shard](./test-parallel.md#shard-tests-between-multiple-machines) tests and execute only selected shard, specified in the form `current/all`, 1-based, for example `3/5`.|
| `--timeout <number>` | Maximum timeout in milliseconds for each test, defaults to 30 seconds. Learn more about [various timeouts](./test-timeouts.md).|
| `--trace <mode>` | Force tracing mode, can be `on`, `off`, `on-first-retry`, `on-all-retries`, `retain-on-failure` |
| `--update-snapshots` or `-u` | Whether to update [snapshots](./test-snapshots.md) with actual results instead of comparing them. Use this when snapshot expectations have changed.|
| `--workers <number>` or `-j <number>`| The maximum number of concurrent worker processes that run in [parallel](./test-parallel.md). |
