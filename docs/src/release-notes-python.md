## Version 1.19

### Highlights

- Locator now supports a `has` option that makes sure it contains another locator inside:

  ```python async
  await page.locator("article", has=page.locator(".highlight")).click()
  ```

  ```python sync
  page.locator("article", has=page.locator(".highlight")).click()
  ```

  Read more in [locator documentation](./api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has)

- New [`method: Locator.page`]
- [`method: Page.screenshot`] and [`method: Locator.screenshot`] now automatically hide blinking caret
- Playwright Codegen now generates locators and frame locators

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 100.0.4863.0
- Mozilla Firefox 96.0.1
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 98
- Microsoft Edge 98


## Version 1.18

### API Testing

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces new [API Testing](./api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Python!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`property: Page.request`] API**:

```python async
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = await page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

```python sync
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

Read more in [our documentation](./api/class-apirequestcontext).

### Web-First Assertions

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces [Web-First Assertions](./test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```python async
from playwright.async_api import Page, expect

async def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    await page.click("#submit-button")
    await expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

```python sync
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    page.click("#submit-button")
    expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](./test-assertions).

### Locator Improvements

- [`method: Locator.dragTo`]
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:
    ```python async
    await page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    ```python sync
    page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    Read more in [locator documentation](./api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has-text)


### New APIs & changes

- [`accept_downloads`](./api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-accept-downloads) option now defaults to `True`.
- [`sources`](./api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-sources) option to embed sources into traces.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 99.0.4812.0
- Mozilla Firefox 95.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 97
- Microsoft Edge 97



## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```python
locator = page.frame_locator("my-frame").locator("text=Submit")
locator.click()
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877831-29e37cd1-e574-4bd9-aab5-b13a463bb4ae.png)

### HTML Report Update

- HTML report now supports dynamic filtering

order_sent.wait_for()
```

Read more about [`method: Locator.waitFor`].

### Docker support for Arm64

Playwright Docker image is now published for Arm64 so it can be used on Apple Silicon.

Read more about [Docker integration](./docker).

### 🎭 Playwright Trace Viewer

By using [`Page.mouse.wheel`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### 📜 New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.all_headers()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.headers_array()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.header_value(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.header_values(name: str)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-response/#response-header-values)

### 🌈 Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.emulate_media()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs

- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.set_checked(selector: str, checked: bool)](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.sizes()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.start_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.stop_chunk()](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ⚡️ New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict=true` into your action calls to opt in.

```py
# This will throw if you have more than one button!
page.click("button", strict=true)
```

#### 📍 New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```py
locator = page.locator("button")
locator.click()
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](./selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](./selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```py
page.click("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]");
page.click("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]");
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](./selectors#vue-selectors).

#### ✨ New [**`nth`**](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```py
# select the first button among all buttons
button.click("button >> nth=0")
# or if you are using locators, you can use first, nth() and last
page.locator("button").first.click()

# click a visible button
button.click("button >> visible=true")
```

## Version 1.12

#### 🧟‍♂️ Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer

[Playwright Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer.md) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`property: BrowserContext.tracing`] API:

```python
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:
