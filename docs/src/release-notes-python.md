## Version 1.45

### Clock

Utilizing the new [Clock] API allows to manipulate and control time within tests to verify time-related behavior. This API covers many common scenarios, including:
* testing with predefined time;
* keeping consistent time and timers;
* monitoring inactivity;
* ticking through time manually.

```python
# Initialize clock with some time before the test time and let the page load
# naturally. `Date.now` will progress as the timers fire.
page.clock.install(time=datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0))
page.goto("http://localhost:3333")

# Pretend that the user closed the laptop lid and opened it again at 10am.
# Pause the time once reached that point.
page.clock.pause_at(datetime.datetime(2024, 2, 2, 10, 0, 0))

# Assert the page state.
expect(page.get_by_test_id("current-time")).to_have_text("2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM")

# Close the laptop lid again and open it at 10:30am.
page.clock.fast_forward("30:00")
expect(page.get_by_test_id("current-time")).to_have_text("2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM")
```

See [the clock guide](./clock.md) for more details.

### Miscellaneous

- Method [`method: Locator.setInputFiles`] now supports uploading a directory for `<input type=file webkitdirectory>` elements.
  ```python
  page.get_by_label("Upload directory").set_input_files('mydir')
  ```

- Multiple methods like [`method: Locator.click`] or [`method: Locator.press`] now support a `ControlOrMeta` modifier key. This key maps to `Meta` on macOS and maps to `Control` on Windows and Linux.
  ```python
  # Press the common keyboard shortcut Control+S or Meta+S to trigger a "Save" operation.
  page.keyboard.press("ControlOrMeta+S")
  ```

- New property `httpCredentials.send` in [`method: APIRequest.newContext`] that allows to either always send the `Authorization` header or only send it in response to `401 Unauthorized`.

- Playwright now supports Chromium, Firefox and WebKit on Ubuntu 24.04.

- v1.45 is the last release to receive WebKit update for macOS 12 Monterey. Please update macOS to keep using the latest WebKit.

### Browser Versions

* Chromium 127.0.6533.5
* Mozilla Firefox 127.0
* WebKit 17.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 126
* Microsoft Edge 126

## Version 1.44

### New APIs

**Accessibility assertions**

- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveAccessibleName`] checks if the element has the specified accessible name:
  ```python
  locator = page.get_by_role("button")
  expect(locator).to_have_accessible_name("Submit")
  ```

- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveAccessibleDescription`] checks if the element has the specified accessible description:
  ```python
  locator = page.get_by_role("button")
  expect(locator).to_have_accessible_description("Upload a photo")
  ```

- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveRole`] checks if the element has the specified ARIA role:
  ```python
  locator = page.get_by_test_id("save-button")
  expect(locator).to_have_role("button")
  ```

**Locator handler**

- After executing the handler added with [`method: Page.addLocatorHandler`], Playwright will now wait until the overlay that triggered the handler is not visible anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with the new `no_wait_after` option.
- You can use new `times` option in [`method: Page.addLocatorHandler`] to specify maximum number of times the handler should be run.
- The handler in [`method: Page.addLocatorHandler`] now accepts the locator as argument.
- New [`method: Page.removeLocatorHandler`] method for removing previously added locator handlers.

```python
locator = page.get_by_text("This interstitial covers the button")
page.add_locator_handler(locator, lambda overlay: overlay.locator("#close").click(), times=3, no_wait_after=True)
# Run your tests that can be interrupted by the overlay.
# ...
page.remove_locator_handler(locator)
```

**Miscellaneous options**

- [`method: PageAssertions.toHaveURL`] now supports `ignore_case` [option](./api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-url-option-ignore-case).

### Browser Versions

* Chromium 125.0.6422.14
* Mozilla Firefox 125.0.1
* WebKit 17.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 124
* Microsoft Edge 124

## Version 1.43

### New APIs

- Method [`method: BrowserContext.clearCookies`] now supports filters to remove only some cookies.

  ```python
  # Clear all cookies.
  context.clear_cookies()
  # New: clear cookies with a particular name.
  context.clear_cookies(name="session-id")
  # New: clear cookies for a particular domain.
  context.clear_cookies(domain="my-origin.com")
  ```

- New method [`method: Locator.contentFrame`] converts a [Locator] object to a [FrameLocator]. This can be useful when you have a [Locator] object obtained somewhere, and later on would like to interact with the content inside the frame.

  ```python
  locator = page.locator("iframe[name='embedded']")
  # ...
  frame_locator = locator.content_frame
  frame_locator.getByRole("button").click()
  ```

- New method [`method: FrameLocator.owner`] converts a [FrameLocator] object to a [Locator]. This can be useful when you have a [FrameLocator] object obtained somewhere, and later on would like to interact with the `iframe` element.

  ```python
  frame_locator = page.frame_locator("iframe[name='embedded']")
  # ...
  locator = frame_locator.owner
  expect(locator).to_be_visible()
  ```

- Conda builds are now published for macOS-arm64 and Linux-arm64.

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 123
* Microsoft Edge 123

## Version 1.42

### New Locator Handler

New method [`method: Page.addLocatorHandler`] registers a callback that will be invoked when specified element becomes visible and may block Playwright actions. The callback can get rid of the overlay. Here is an example that closes a cookie dialog when it appears.

```python
# Setup the handler.
page.add_locator_handler(
    page.get_by_role("heading", name="Hej! You are in control of your cookies."),
    lambda: page.get_by_role("button", name="Accept all").click(),
)
# Write the test as usual.
page.goto("https://www.ikea.com/")
page.get_by_role("link", name="Collection of blue and white").click()
expect(page.get_by_role("heading", name="Light and easy")).to_be_visible()
```

### New APIs

- [`method: Page.pdf`] accepts two new options [`option: tagged`] and [`option: outline`].

## Version 1.41

### New APIs

- New method [`method: Page.unrouteAll`] removes all routes registered by [`method: Page.route`] and [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`]. Optionally allows to wait for ongoing routes to finish, or ignore any errors from them.
- New method [`method: BrowserContext.unrouteAll`] removes all routes registered by [`method: BrowserContext.route`] and [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`]. Optionally allows to wait for ongoing routes to finish, or ignore any errors from them.

New tools to generate assertions:
- "Assert visibility" tool generates [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`].
- "Assert value" tool generates [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValue`].
- "Assert text" tool generates [`method: LocatorAssertions.toContainText`].

Here is an example of a generated test with assertions:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

def test_example(page: Page) -> None:
    page.goto("https://playwright.dev/")
    page.get_by_role("link", name="Get started").click()
    expect(page.get_by_label("Breadcrumbs").get_by_role("list")).to_contain_text("Installation")
    expect(page.get_by_label("Search")).to_be_visible()
    page.get_by_label("Search").click()
    page.get_by_placeholder("Search docs").fill("locator")
    expect(page.get_by_placeholder("Search docs")).to_have_value("locator");
```

### New APIs

- Option [`option: reason`] in [`method: Page.close`], [`method: BrowserContext.close`] and [`method: Browser.close`]. Close reason is reported for all operations interrupted by the closure.
- Option [`option: firefoxUserPrefs`] in [`method: BrowserType.launchPersistentContext`].

### Other Changes

- Method [`method: Download.path`] throws an error for failed and cancelled downloads.

    ```python
    button = page.get_by_role("button").and_(page.get_by_title("Subscribe"))
    ```

* New events [`event: BrowserContext.console`] and [`event: BrowserContext.dialog`] to subscribe to any dialogs
  and console messages from any page from the given browser context. Use the new methods [`method: ConsoleMessage.page`]
  and [`method: Dialog.page`] to pin-point event source.

* Mozilla Firefox 113.0
* WebKit 16.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 113

## Version 1.33

### Locators Update

* Use [`method: Locator.or`] to create a locator that matches either of the two locators.
  Consider a scenario where you'd like to click on a "New email" button, but sometimes a security settings dialog shows up instead.
  In this case, you can wait for either a "New email" button, or a dialog and act accordingly:

  ```python
  new_email = page.get_by_role("button", name="New email")
  dialog = page.get_by_text("Confirm security settings")
  expect(new_email.or_(dialog)).is_visible()
  if (dialog.is_visible()):
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Dismiss").click()
  new_email.click()
  ```
* Use new options [`option: hasNot`] and [`option: hasNotText`] in [`method: Locator.filter`]
  to find elements that **do not match** certain conditions.

  ```python
  row_locator = page.locator("tr")
  row_locator.filter(has_not_text="text in column 1").filter(
      has_not=page.get_by_role("button", name="column 2 button")
  ).screenshot()
  ```
* Use new web-first assertion [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeAttached`] to ensure that the element
  is present in the page's DOM. Do not confuse with the [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`] that ensures that
  element is both attached & visible.

### New APIs

- [`method: Locator.or`]
- New option [`option: hasNot`] in [`method: Locator.filter`]
- New option [`option: hasNotText`] in [`method: Locator.filter`]
- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeAttached`]
- New option [`option: timeout`] in [`method: Route.fetch`]

### ⚠️ Breaking change

* The `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.33.0` now serves a Playwright image based on Ubuntu Jammy.
  To use the focal-based image, please use `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.33.0-focal` instead.

  ```python
  from playwright.sync_api import expect

  locator = page.get_by_role("button")

  # Make sure at least some part of element intersects viewport.
  expect(locator).to_be_in_viewport()

  # Make sure element is fully outside of viewport.
  expect(locator).not_to_be_in_viewport()

  # Make sure that at least half of the element intersects viewport.
  expect(locator).to_be_in_viewport(ratio=0.5)
  ```

    ```python
    def handle_route(route: Route):
      # Fetch original settings.
      response = route.fetch()

      # Force settings theme to a predefined value.
      json = response.json()
      json["theme"] = "Solorized"

      # Fulfill with modified data.
      route.fulfill(json=json)


    page.route("**/api/settings", handle_route)
    ```

- New method [`method: Locator.all`] to iterate over all matching elements:

    ```python
    # Check all checkboxes!
    checkboxes = page.get_by_role("checkbox")
    for checkbox in checkboxes.all():
      checkbox.check()
    ```

- [`method: Locator.selectOption`] matches now by value or label:

  ```html

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 108
* Microsoft Edge 108

## Version 1.28

### Playwright Tools

* **Live Locators in CodeGen.** Generate a locator for any element on the page using "Explore" tool.

![Locator Explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9798949/202293514-8e2eade6-c809-4b0a-864b-899dfcee3d84.png)

- [`method: Locator.blur`]
- [`method: Locator.clear`]

### Browser Versions

* Chromium 108.0.5359.29
* Mozilla Firefox 106.0
* WebKit 16.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 107
* Microsoft Edge 107


## Version 1.27

### Locators

With these new APIs writing locators is a joy:
- [`method: Page.getByText`] to locate by text content.
- [`method: Page.getByRole`] to locate by [ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#roles), [ARIA attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-attributes) and [accessible name](https://w3c.github.io/accname/#dfn-accessible-name).
- [`method: Page.getByLabel`] to locate a form control by associated label's text.
- [`method: Page.getByTestId`] to locate an element based on its `data-testid` attribute (other attribute can be configured).
- [`method: Page.getByPlaceholder`] to locate an input by placeholder.
- [`method: Page.getByAltText`] to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
- [`method: Page.getByTitle`] to locate an element by its title.

```python
page.get_by_label("User Name").fill("John")

page.get_by_label("Password").fill("secret-password")

page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign in").click()

expect(page.get_by_text("Welcome, John!")).to_be_visible()
```

All the same methods are also available on [Locator], [FrameLocator] and [Frame] classes.

### Other highlights

- As announced in v1.25, Ubuntu 18 will not be supported as of Dec 2022. In addition to that, there will be no WebKit updates on Ubuntu 18 starting from the next Playwright release.

### Behavior Changes

- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveAttribute`] with an empty value does not match missing attribute anymore. For example, the following snippet will succeed when `button` **does not** have a `disabled` attribute.

   ```python
   expect(page.get_by_role("button")).to_have_attribute("disabled", "")
   ```

### Browser Versions

* Chromium 107.0.5304.18
* Mozilla Firefox 105.0.1
* WebKit 16.0

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

* Google Chrome 106
* Microsoft Edge 106


## Version 1.26

### Assertions

- New option `enabled` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEnabled`].
- [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now pierces open shadow roots.
- New option `editable` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEditable`].
- New option `visible` for [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`].

### Other highlights

- New option `max_redirects` for [`method: APIRequestContext.get`] and others to limit redirect count.
- Python 3.11 is now supported.

### Behavior Change

A bunch of Playwright APIs already support the `wait_until: "domcontentloaded"` option.
For example:

```python
page.goto("https://playwright.dev", wait_until="domcontentloaded")
```

Prior to 1.26, this would wait for all iframes to fire the `DOMContentLoaded`
event.

To align with web specification, the `'domcontentloaded'` value only waits for
the target frame to fire the `'DOMContentLoaded'` event. Use `wait_until="load"` to wait for all iframes.

### 🐂 Debian 11 Bullseye Support

Playwright now supports Debian 11 Bullseye on x86_64 for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. Let us know
if you encounter any issues!

Linux support looks like this:

|          | Ubuntu 20.04 | Ubuntu 22.04 | Debian 11
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Chromium | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| WebKit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Firefox | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### New introduction docs

We rewrote our Getting Started docs to be more end-to-end testing focused. Check them out on [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).

## Version 1.23

### Network Replay

Now you can record network traffic into a HAR file and re-use this traffic in your tests.

To record network into HAR file:

```bash
npx playwright open --save-har=github.har.zip https://github.com/microsoft
```

Alternatively, you can record HAR programmatically:

```python async
context = await browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
# ... do stuff ...
await context.close()
```

```python sync
context = browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
# ... do stuff ...
context.close()
```

Use the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] or [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] to serve matching responses from the [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/) file:


```python async
await context.route_from_har("github.har.zip")
```

```python sync
context.route_from_har("github.har.zip")
```

Read more in [our documentation](./mock.md#mocking-with-har-files).


### Advanced Routing

You can now use [`method: Route.fallback`] to defer routing to other handlers.

Consider the following example:

```python async
# Remove a header from all requests
async def remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    headers = await route.request.all_headers()
    if "if-none-match" in headers:
        del headers["if-none-match"]
    await route.fallback(headers=headers)

await page.route("**/*", remove_header_handler)

# Abort all images
async def abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    if route.request.resource_type == "image":
        await route.abort()
    else:
        await route.fallback()

await page.route("**/*", abort_images_handler)
```

```python sync
# Remove a header from all requests
def remove_header_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    headers = route.request.all_headers()
    if "if-none-match" in headers:
        del headers["if-none-match"]
    route.fallback(headers=headers)

page.route("**/*", remove_header_handler)

# Abort all images
def abort_images_handler(route: Route) -> None:
    if route.request.resource_type == "image":
        route.abort()
    else:
        route.fallback()

page.route("**/*", abort_images_handler)
```

Note that the new methods [`method: Page.routeFromHAR`] and [`method: BrowserContext.routeFromHAR`] also participate in routing and could be deferred to.

### Web-First Assertions Update

* New method [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValues`] that asserts all selected values of `<select multiple>` element.
* Methods [`method: LocatorAssertions.toContainText`] and [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] now accept `ignore_case` option.

### Miscellaneous

* If there's a service worker that's in your way, you can now easily disable it with a new context option `service_workers`:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(service_workers="block")
  page = await context.new_page()
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(service_workers="block")
  page = context.new_page()
  ```

* Using `.zip` path for `recordHar` context option automatically zips the resulting HAR:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(record_har_path="github.har.zip")
  ```

* If you intend to edit HAR by hand, consider using the `"minimal"` HAR recording mode
  that only records information that is essential for replaying:

  ```python async
  context = await browser.new_context(record_har_mode="minimal", record_har_path="har.har")
  ```

  ```python sync
  context = browser.new_context(record_har_mode="minimal", record_har_path="har.har")
  ```

* Playwright now runs on Ubuntu 22 amd64 and Ubuntu 22 arm64.

- Mozilla Firefox 96.0.1
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 98
- Microsoft Edge 98


## Version 1.18

### API Testing

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces new [API Testing](./api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Python!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`property: Page.request`] API**:

```python async
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = await page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

```python sync
# Do a GET request on behalf of page
res = page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

Read more in [our documentation](./api/class-apirequestcontext).

### Web-First Assertions

Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces [Web-First Assertions](./test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```python async
from playwright.async_api import Page, expect

async def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    await page.locator("#submit-button").click()
    await expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

```python sync
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    page.locator("#submit-button").click()
    expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](./test-assertions).

### Locator Improvements

- [`method: Locator.dragTo`]
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:
    ```python async
    await page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    ```python sync
    page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    Read more in [locator documentation](./api/class-locator#locator-locator)


### New APIs & changes

- [`accept_downloads`](./api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-accept-downloads) option now defaults to `True`.
- [`sources`](./api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-sources) option to embed sources into traces.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 99.0.4812.0
- Mozilla Firefox 95.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 97
- Microsoft Edge 97



## Version 1.17

### Frame Locators

Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators](./api/class-framelocator) - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`method: Page.frameLocator`] or [`method: Locator.frameLocator`] method.

```python
locator = page.frame_locator("my-frame").locator("text=Submit")
locator.click()
```

Read more at [our documentation](./api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877831-29e37cd1-e574-4bd9-aab5-b13a463bb4ae.png)

### HTML Report Update

- HTML report now supports dynamic filtering
- Report is now a **single static HTML file** that could be sent by e-mail or as a slack attachment.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/141877402-e486643d-72c7-4db3-8844-ed2072c5d676.png)

### Ubuntu ARM64 support + more

- Playwright now supports **Ubuntu 20.04 ARM64**. You can now run Playwright tests inside Docker on Apple M1 and on Raspberry Pi.
- You can now use Playwright to install stable version of Edge on Linux:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install msedge
    ```

### New APIs

- Tracing now supports a [`'title'`](./api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-title) option
- Page navigations support a new [`'commit'`](./api/class-page#page-goto) waiting option


## Version 1.16

### 🎭 Playwright Library

#### `locator.wait_for`

Wait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state.
Defaults to the `state: 'visible'`.

Comes especially handy when working with lists:

```python
order_sent = page.locator("#order-sent")
order_sent.wait_for()
```

Read more about [`method: Locator.waitFor`].

### Docker support for Arm64

Playwright Docker image is now published for Arm64 so it can be used on Apple Silicon.

Read more about [Docker integration](./docker).

### 🎭 Playwright Trace Viewer

- run trace viewer with `npx playwright show-trace` and drop trace files to the trace viewer PWA
- better visual attribution of action targets

Read more about [Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer).

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 97.0.4666.0
- Mozilla Firefox 93.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version of Playwright was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 94
- Microsoft Edge 94

## Version 1.15

### 🖱️ Mouse Wheel

By using [`method: Mouse.wheel`] you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### 📜 New Headers API

Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [`method: Request.allHeaders`]
- [`method: Request.headersArray`]
- [`method: Request.headerValue`]
- [`method: Response.allHeaders`]
- [`method: Response.headersArray`]
- [`method: Response.headerValue`]
- [`method: Response.headerValues`]

### 🌈 Forced-Colors emulation

Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [`method: Browser.newContext`] or calling [`method: Page.emulateMedia`].

### New APIs

- [`method: Page.route`] accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [`method: Page.setChecked`] and [`method: Locator.setChecked`] were introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [`method: Request.sizes`] Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [`method: Tracing.startChunk`] - Start a new trace chunk.
- [`method: Tracing.stopChunk`] - Stops a new trace chunk.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 96.0.4641.0
- Mozilla Firefox 92.0
- WebKit 15.0

## Version 1.14

#### ⚡️ New "strict" mode

Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict=true` into your action calls to opt in.

```py
# This will throw if you have more than one button!
page.click("button", strict=True)
```

#### 📍 New [**Locators API**](./api/class-locator)

Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](./api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](./api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](./api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```py
locator = page.locator("button")
locator.click()
```

Learn more in the [documentation](./api/class-locator).

#### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](./other-locators.md#react-locator) and [**Vue**](./other-locators.md#vue-locator) selector engines

React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```py
page.locator("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]").click()
page.locator("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]").click()
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](./other-locators.md#react-locator) and the [vue selectors documentation](./other-locators.md#vue-locator).

#### ✨ New [**`nth`**](./other-locators.md#n-th-element-locator) and [**`visible`**](./other-locators.md#css-matching-only-visible-elements) selector engines

- [`nth`](./other-locators.md#n-th-element-locator) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](./other-locators.md#css-matching-only-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```py
# select the first button among all buttons
button.click("button >> nth=0")
# or if you are using locators, you can use first, nth() and last
page.locator("button").first.click()

# click a visible button
button.click("button >> visible=true")
```

## Version 1.12

#### 🧟‍♂️ Introducing Playwright Trace Viewer

[Playwright Trace Viewer](./trace-viewer.md) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`property: BrowserContext.tracing`] API:

```python
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

# Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

# Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:
