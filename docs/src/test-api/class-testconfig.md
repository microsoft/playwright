# class: TestConfig
* since: v1.10
* langs: js

Playwright Test provides many options to configure how your tests are collected and executed, for example `timeout` or `testDir`. These options are described in the [TestConfig] object in the [configuration file](../test-configuration.md). This type describes format of the configuration file, to access resolved configuration parameters at run time use [FullConfig].

Playwright Test supports running multiple test projects at the same time. Project-specific options should be put to [`property: TestConfig.projects`], but top-level [TestConfig] can also define base options shared between all projects.

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30000,
  globalTimeout: 600000,
  reporter: 'list',
  testDir: './tests',
});
```

```

## property: TestConfig.forbidOnly
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[boolean]>

Whether to exit with an error if any tests or groups are marked as [`method: Test.only`] or [`method: Test.describe.only`]. Useful on CI.

**Usage**

export default defineConfig({
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.fullyParallel
* since: v1.20
- type: ?<[boolean]>

Playwright Test runs tests in parallel. In order to achieve that, it runs several worker processes that run at the same time.
By default, **test files** are run in parallel. Tests in a single file are run in order, in the same worker process.

You can configure entire test run to concurrently execute all tests in all files using this option.

**Usage**

export default defineConfig({
  globalSetup: './global-setup',
});
```

## property: TestConfig.globalTeardown
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[string]|[Array]<[string]>>

Path to the global teardown file. This file will be required and run after all the tests. It must export a single function. See also [`property: TestConfig.globalSetup`]. Pass an array of paths to specify multiple global teardown files.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  globalTimeout: process.env.CI ? 60 * 60 * 1000 : undefined,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.grep
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[RegExp]|[Array]<[RegExp]>>

Filter to only run tests with a title matching one of the patterns. For example, passing `grep: /cart/` should only run tests with "cart" in the title. Also available in the [command line](../test-cli.md) with the `-g` option. The regular expression will be tested against the string that consists of the project name, the test file name, the `test.describe` name (if any), the test name and the test tags divided by spaces, e.g. `chromium my-test.spec.ts my-suite my-test`.

`grep` option is also useful for [tagging tests](../test-annotations.md#tag-tests).

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  grep: /smoke/,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.grepInvert
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[RegExp]|[Array]<[RegExp]>>

Filter to only run tests with a title **not** matching one of the patterns. This is the opposite of [`property: TestConfig.grep`]. Also available in the [command line](../test-cli.md) with the `--grep-invert` option.

`grepInvert` option is also useful for [tagging tests](../test-annotations.md#tag-tests).

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  grepInvert: /manual/,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.ignoreSnapshots
* since: v1.26
- type: ?<[boolean]>

Whether to skip snapshot expectations, such as `expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()` and `await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()`.

import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  ignoreSnapshots: !process.env.CI,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.maxFailures
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[int]>

The maximum number of test failures for the whole test suite run. After reaching this number, testing will stop and exit with an error. Setting to zero (default) disables this behavior.

Also available in the [command line](../test-cli.md) with the `--max-failures` and `-x` options.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  maxFailures: process.env.CI ? 1 : 0,
});
```

## property: TestConfig.metadata
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[Metadata]>

  metadata: 'acceptance tests',
});
```

## property: TestConfig.name
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[string]>

Config name is visible in the report and during test execution, unless overridden by [`property: TestProject.name`].

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

  name: 'acceptance tests',
});
```

## property: TestConfig.outputDir
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[string]>

The output directory for files created during test execution. Defaults to `<package.json-directory>/test-results`.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: './test-results',
});
```

**Details**

This directory is cleaned at the start. When running a test, a unique subdirectory inside the [`property: TestConfig.outputDir`] is created, guaranteeing that test running in parallel do not conflict. This directory can be accessed by [`property: TestInfo.outputDir`] and [`method: TestInfo.outputPath`].

Here is an example that uses [`method: TestInfo.outputPath`] to create a temporary file.

```js
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import fs from 'fs';

test('example test', async ({}, testInfo) => {
  const file = testInfo.outputPath('temporary-file.txt');
  await fs.promises.writeFile(file, 'Put some data to the file', 'utf8');
});
```


## property: TestConfig.snapshotDir

* discouraged: Use [`property: TestConfig.snapshotPathTemplate`] to configure snapshot paths.
- type: ?<[string]>

The base directory, relative to the config file, for snapshot files created with `toMatchSnapshot`. Defaults to [`property: TestConfig.testDir`].

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  snapshotDir: './snapshots',
});
```

**Details**

The directory for each test can be accessed by [`property: TestInfo.snapshotDir`] and [`method: TestInfo.snapshotPath`].

This path will serve as the base directory for each test file snapshot directory. Setting `snapshotDir` to `'snapshots'`, the [`property: TestInfo.snapshotDir`] would resolve to `snapshots/a.spec.js-snapshots`.

});
```

## property: TestConfig.reporter
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[string]|[Array]<[Object]>|[BuiltInReporter]<"list"|"dot"|"line"|"github"|"json"|"junit"|"null"|"html">>

  - `threshold` <[float]> Test duration in milliseconds that is considered slow. Defaults to 15 seconds.

Whether to report slow test files. Pass `null` to disable this feature.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reportSlowTests: null,
});
```

**Details**

## property: TestConfig.respectGitIgnore
* since: v1.45
- type: ?<[boolean]>

Whether to skip entries from `.gitignore` when searching for test files. By default, if neither [`property: TestConfig.testDir`] nor [`property: TestProject.testDir`] are explicitly specified, Playwright will ignore any test files matching `.gitignore` entries.

## property: TestConfig.retries

});
```

## property: TestConfig.testIgnore
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[string]|[RegExp]|[Array]<[string]|[RegExp]>>

Files matching one of these patterns are not executed as test files. Matching is performed against the absolute file path. Strings are treated as glob patterns.

For example, `'**/test-assets/**'` will ignore any files in the `test-assets` directory.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testIgnore: '**/test-assets/**',
});
```

Note that `tsconfig` property has no effect while the configuration file or any of its dependencies are loaded. Ignored when `--tsconfig` command line option is specified.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({

* `'changed'` - All tests that are executed will update snapshots that did not match. Matching snapshots will not be updated.
* `'missing'` - Missing snapshots are created, for example when authoring a new test and running it for the first time. This is the default.
* `'none'` - No snapshots are updated.

Learn more about [snapshots](../test-snapshots.md).

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  updateSnapshots: 'missing',
});
```

## property: TestConfig.updateSourceMethod
* since: v1.50
- type: ?<[UpdateSourceMethod]<"overwrite"|"3way"|"patch">>

Defines how to update the source code snapshots.
* `'overwrite'` - Overwrite the source code snapshot with the actual result.
* `'3way'` - Use a three-way merge to update the source code snapshot.
* `'patch'` - Use a patch to update the source code snapshot. This is the default.

## property: TestConfig.use
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[TestOptions]>

Global options for all tests, for example [`property: TestOptions.browserName`]. Learn more about [configuration](../test-configuration.md) and see [available options][TestOptions].

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    browserName: 'chromium',
  },
});
```

## property: TestConfig.webServer
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[Object]|[Array]<[Object]>>
  - `command` <[string]> Shell command to start. For example `npm run start`..
  - `cwd` ?<[string]> Current working directory of the spawned process, defaults to the directory of the configuration file.
  - `env` ?<[Object]<[string], [string]>> Environment variables to set for the command, `process.env` by default.
  - `ignoreHTTPSErrors` ?<[boolean]> Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when fetching the `url`. Defaults to `false`.
  - `port` ?<[int]> The port that your http server is expected to appear on. It does wait until it accepts connections. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.
  - `reuseExistingServer` ?<[boolean]> If true, it will re-use an existing server on the `port` or `url` when available. If no server is running on that `port` or `url`, it will run the command to start a new server. If `false`, it will throw if an existing process is listening on the `port` or `url`. This should be commonly set to `!process.env.CI` to allow the local dev server when running tests locally.
  - `stdout` ?<["pipe"|"ignore"]> If `"pipe"`, it will pipe the stdout of the command to the process stdout. If `"ignore"`, it will ignore the stdout of the command. Default to `"ignore"`.
  - `stderr` ?<["pipe"|"ignore"]> Whether to pipe the stderr of the command to the process stderr or ignore it. Defaults to `"pipe"`.
  - `timeout` ?<[int]> How long to wait for the process to start up and be available in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000.
  - `url` ?<[string]> The url on your http server that is expected to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code when the server is ready to accept connections. Redirects (3xx status codes) are being followed and the new location is checked. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.

Launch a development web server (or multiple) during the tests.

**Details**

If the port is specified, Playwright Test will wait for it to be available on `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, before running the tests. If the url is specified, Playwright Test will wait for the URL to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code before running the tests.

For continuous integration, you may want to use the `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` option which does not use an existing server on the CI. To see the stdout, you can set the `DEBUG=pw:webserver` environment variable.

The `port` (but not the `url`) gets passed over to Playwright as a [`property: TestOptions.baseURL`]. For example port `8080` produces `baseURL` equal `http://localhost:8080`. If `webServer` is specified as an array, you must explicitly configure the `baseURL` (even if it only has one entry).

:::note
It is also recommended to specify [`property: TestOptions.baseURL`] in the config, so that tests could use relative urls.
:::

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
  },
});
```

Now you can use a relative path when navigating the page:

```js title="test.spec.ts"
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  // This will result in http://localhost:3000/foo
  await page.goto('/foo');
});
```

Multiple web servers (or background processes) can be launched:

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: [
    {
      command: 'npm run start',
      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    },
    {
      command: 'npm run backend',
      url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3333',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    }
  ],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
  },
});
```

## property: TestConfig.workers
* since: v1.10
- type: ?<[int]|[string]>

The maximum number of concurrent worker processes to use for parallelizing tests. Can also be set as percentage of logical CPU cores, e.g. `'50%'.`

Playwright Test uses worker processes to run tests. There is always at least one worker process, but more can be used to speed up test execution.

Defaults to half of the number of logical CPU cores. Learn more about [parallelism and sharding](../test-parallel.md) with Playwright Test.

**Usage**

```js title="playwright.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  workers: 3,
});
```
