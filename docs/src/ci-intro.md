## Setting up GitHub Actions
* langs: js

When [installing Playwright](./intro.md) using the [VS Code extension](./getting-started-vscode.md) or with `npm init playwright@latest` you are given the option to add a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow. This creates a `playwright.yml` file inside a `.github/workflows` folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch. Here's how that file looks:

```yml js title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

The workflow performs these steps:

1. Clone your repository
2. Install Node.js
3. Install NPM Dependencies
4. Install Playwright Browsers
5. Run Playwright tests
6. Upload HTML report to the GitHub UI

To learn more about this, see ["Understanding GitHub Actions"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

## Setting up GitHub Actions
* langs: python, java, csharp

To add a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) file first create `.github/workflows` folder and inside it add a `playwright.yml` file containing the example code below so that your tests will run on each push and pull request for the main/master branch.

```yml python title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Ensure browsers are installed
      run: python -m playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run your tests
      run: pytest --tracing=retain-on-failure
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-traces
        path: test-results/
```

```yml java title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'
    - name: Build & Install
      run: mvn -B install -D skipTests --no-transfer-progress
    - name: Ensure browsers are installed
      run: mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --with-deps"
    - name: Run tests
      run: mvn test
```

```yml csharp title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Setup dotnet
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: 8.0.x
    - name: Build & Install
      run: dotnet build
    - name: Ensure browsers are installed
      run: pwsh bin/Debug/net8.0/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps
    - name: Run your tests
      run: dotnet test
```

To learn more about this, see ["Understanding GitHub Actions"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

Looking at the list of steps in `jobs.test.steps`, you can see that the workflow performs these steps:

1. Clone your repository
2. Install language dependencies
3. Install project dependencies and build
4. Install Playwright Browsers
5. Run tests

## Create a Repo and Push to GitHub

Once you have your [GitHub actions workflow](#setting-up-github-actions) setup then all you need to do is [Create a repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to [initialize a git repository](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init) using the `git init` command so you can [add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add), [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) and [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) your code.

## HTML Report
* langs: js

The HTML Report shows you a full report of your tests. You can filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests and flaky tests.

### Downloading the HTML Report
* langs: js

In the Artifacts section click on the **playwright-report** to download your report in the format of a zip file.

<img width="972" alt="Downloading the HTML Report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183437023-524f1803-84e4-4862-9ce3-1d55af0e023e.png" />

### Viewing the HTML Report
* langs: js

Locally opening the report will not work as expected as you need a web server in order for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line change into the directory where the report is and use `npx playwright show-report` followed by the name of the extracted folder. This will serve up the report and enable you to view it in your browser.


```bash
npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report
```

To learn more about reports check out our detailed guide on [HTML Reporter](/test-reporters.md#html-reporter)

## Viewing the Trace
* langs: js

Once you have served the report using `npx playwright show-report`, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.

![playwright trace viewer](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/10fe3585-8401-4051-b1c2-b2e92ac4c274)

## Viewing the Trace
* langs: python, java

[trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop.

![playwright trace viewer](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/6d5885dc-d511-4c20-b728-040a7ef6cea4)

## Viewing the Trace
* langs: csharp

You can upload Traces which get created on your CI like GitHub Actions as artifacts. This requires [starting and stopping the trace](./trace-viewer-intro#recording-a-trace). We recommend only recording traces for failing tests. Once your traces have been uploaded to CI, they can then be downloaded and opened using [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev), which is a statically hosted variant of the Trace Viewer. You can upload trace files using drag and drop.

## Publishing report on the web
* langs: js

Downloading the HTML report as a zip file is not very convenient. However, we can utilize Azure Storage's static websites hosting capabilities to easily and efficiently serve HTML reports on the Internet, requiring minimal configuration.

1. Create an [Azure Storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).
1. Enable [Static website hosting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to#enable-static-website-hosting) for the storage account.
1. Create a Service Principal in Azure and grant it access to Azure Blob storage. Upon successful execution, the command will display the credentials which will be used in the next step.

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
    ```
1. Use the credentials from the previous step to set up encrypted secrets in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings, under [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository), and add the following secrets:

    - `AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID`
    - `AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `AZCOPY_TENANT_ID`

   For a detailed guide on how to authorize a service principal using a client secret, refer to [this Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-authorize-azure-active-directory#authorize-a-service-principal-by-using-a-client-secret-1).
1. Add a step that uploads the HTML report to Azure Storage.

    ```yaml title=".github/workflows/playwright.yml"
    ...
        - name: Upload HTML report to Azure
          shell: bash
          run: |
            REPORT_DIR='run-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}'
            azcopy cp --recursive "./playwright-report/*" "https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/\$web/$REPORT_DIR"
            echo "::notice title=HTML report url::https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.z1.web.core.windows.net/$REPORT_DIR/index.html"
          env:
            AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE: SPN
            AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID }}'
            AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
            AZCOPY_TENANT_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_TENANT_ID }}'
    ```

The contents of the `$web` storage container can be accessed from a browser by using the [public URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal#portal-find-url) of the website.

:::note
This step will not work for pull requests created from a forked repository because such workflow [doesn't have access to the secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).
