## Version 1.10

- [Playwright for Java v1.10](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java) is **now stable**!
- Run Playwright against **Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge** stable channels with the [new channels API](./browsers).
- Chromium screenshots are **fast** on Mac & Windows.

#### Bundled Browser Versions

- Chromium 90.0.4430.0
- Mozilla Firefox 87.0b10
- WebKit 14.2

This version of Playwright was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 89
- Microsoft Edge 89

#### New APIs

- [`browserType.launch()`](./api/class-browsertype#browsertypelaunchoptions) now accepts the new `'channel'` option. Read more in [our documentation](./browsers).


## Version 1.9

- [Playwright Inspector](./inspector.md) is a **new GUI tool** to author and debug your tests.
  - **Line-by-line debugging** of your Playwright scripts, with play, pause and step-through.
  - Author new scripts by **recording user actions**.
  - **Generate element selectors** for your script by hovering over elements.
  - Set the `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable to launch the Inspector

- **Pause script execution** with [`method: Page.pause`] in headed mode. Pausing the page launches [Playwright Inspector](./inspector.md) for debugging.

- **New has-text pseudo-class** for CSS selectors. `:has-text("example")` matches any element containing `"example"` somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. See [more examples](./selectors.md#text-selector).

- **Page dialogs are now auto-dismissed** during execution, unless a listener for `dialog` event is configured. [Learn more](./dialogs.md) about this.

- [Playwright for Python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) is **now stable** with an idiomatic snake case API and pre-built [Docker image](./docker.md) to run tests in CI/CD.

- Playwright now includes [command line interface](./cli.md), former playwright-cli.
  ```sh js
  $ npx playwright --help
  ```
  ```sh python
  $ playwright --help
  ```
- [`method: Page.selectOption`] now waits for the options to be present.
