   * **Details**

   * If the port is specified, Playwright Test will wait for it to be available on `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, before running
   * the tests. If the url is specified, Playwright Test will wait for the URL to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or
   * 403 status code before running the tests.
   *
   * For continuous integration, you may want to use the `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` option which does not
   * use an existing server on the CI. To see the stdout, you can set the `DEBUG=pw:webserver` environment variable.
   *
   * The `port` (but not the `url`) gets passed over to Playwright as a
   * [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url). For example port
   * `8080` produces `baseURL` equal `http://localhost:8080`. If `webServer` is specified as an array, you must

   *

   * [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) in the config, so
   * that tests could use relative urls.
   *
   * **Usage**
   *
   * ```js
   * // playwright.config.ts
   * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   webServer: {

   *   use: {
   *     baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
   *   },
   * });
   * ```
   *

   * test('test', async ({ page }) => {

   * - `{testDir}` - Project's
   *   [testConfig.testDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-test-dir).
   *   - Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (absolute path is since `testDir` is resolved relative to directory with

   * - `{snapshotDir}` - Project's
   *   [testConfig.snapshotDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-snapshot-dir).
   *   - Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (since `snapshotDir` is not provided in config, it defaults to `testDir`)
   * - `{platform}` - The value of `process.platform`.
   * - `{projectName}` - Project's file-system-sanitized name, if any.
   *   - Value: `''` (empty string).
   * - `{testFileDir}` - Directories in relative path from `testDir` to **test file**.
   *   - Value: `page`
   * - `{testFileName}` - Test file name with extension.
   *   - Value: `page-click.spec.ts`
   * - `{testFilePath}` - Relative path from `testDir` to **test file**
   *   - Value: `page/page-click.spec.ts`
   * - `{testName}` - File-system-sanitized test title, including parent describes but excluding file name.
   *   - Value: `suite-test-should-work`
   * - `{arg}` - Relative snapshot path **without extension**. These come from the arguments passed to the
   *   `toHaveScreenshot()` and `toMatchSnapshot()` calls; if called without arguments, this will be an auto-generated
   *   snapshot name.
   *   - Value: `foo/bar/baz`
   * - `{ext}` - snapshot extension (with dots)
   *   - Value: `.png`
   *
   * Each token can be preceded with a single character that will be used **only if** this token has non-empty value.
   *
   * Consider the following config:

   *
   * In this config:

   * 1. Second project **does** have a name, so its snapshots will be stored in
