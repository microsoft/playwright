 * Test runner notifies the reporter about various events during test execution. All methods of the reporter are

 *
 * You can create a custom reporter by implementing a class with some of the reporter methods. Make sure to export
 * this class as default.
 *
 * ```js
 * // my-awesome-reporter.ts
 * import type {
 *   Reporter, FullConfig, Suite, TestCase, TestResult, FullResult
 * } from '@playwright/test/reporter';
 *
 * class MyReporter implements Reporter {
 *   constructor(options: { customOption?: string } = {}) {
 *     console.log(`my-awesome-reporter setup with customOption set to ${options.customOption}`);
 *   }
 *
 *   onBegin(config: FullConfig, suite: Suite) {
 *     console.log(`Starting the run with ${suite.allTests().length} tests`);
 *   }
 *
 *   onTestBegin(test: TestCase) {
 *     console.log(`Starting test ${test.title}`);
 *   }
 *
 *   onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) {
 *     console.log(`Finished test ${test.title}: ${result.status}`);
 *   }
 *
 *   onEnd(result: FullResult) {
 *     console.log(`Finished the run: ${result.status}`);
 *   }
 * }
 * export default MyReporter;
 * ```
 *
 * Now use this reporter with
 * [testConfig.reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-reporter). Learn more about
 * [using reporters](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters).
 *
 * ```js
 * // playwright.config.ts
 * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
 *
 * export default defineConfig({
 *   reporter: [['./my-awesome-reporter.ts', { customOption: 'some value' }]],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Here is a typical order of reporter calls:
 * - [reporter.onBegin(config, suite)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-begin) is called
 *   once with a root suite that contains all other suites and tests. Learn more about [suites hierarchy]{@link
 *   Suite}.
 * - [reporter.onTestBegin(test, result)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-test-begin) is
 *   called for each test run. It is given a {@link TestCase} that is executed, and a {@link TestResult} that is
 *   almost empty. Test result will be populated while the test runs (for example, with steps and stdio) and will
 *   get final `status` once the test finishes.
 * - [reporter.onStepBegin(test, result, step)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-step-begin)
 *   and
 *   [reporter.onStepEnd(test, result, step)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-step-end)
 *   are called for each executed step inside the test. When steps are executed, test run has not finished yet.
 * - [reporter.onTestEnd(test, result)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-test-end) is
 *   called when test run has finished. By this time, {@link TestResult} is complete and you can use
 *   [testResult.status](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult#test-result-status),
 *   [testResult.error](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult#test-result-error) and more.
 * - [reporter.onEnd(result)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-end) is called once after
 *   all tests that should run had finished.
 * - [reporter.onExit()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-exit) is called immediately
 *   before the test runner exits.
 *
 * Additionally,
 * [reporter.onStdOut(chunk, test, result)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-std-out) and
 * [reporter.onStdErr(chunk, test, result)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-std-err) are
 * called when standard output is produced in the worker process, possibly during a test execution, and
 * [reporter.onError(error)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-error) is called when
 * something went wrong outside of the test execution.
 *
 * If your custom reporter does not print anything to the terminal, implement
 * [reporter.printsToStdio()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-prints-to-stdio) and return
 * `false`. This way, Playwright will use one of the standard terminal reporters in addition to your custom reporter
 * to enhance user experience.
 *
 * **Merged report API notes**
 *
 * When merging multiple [`blob`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters#blob-reporter) reports via
 * [`merge-reports`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding#merge-reports-cli) CLI command, the same {@link Reporter} API is called to
 * produce final reports and all existing reporters should work without any changes. There some subtle differences
 * though which might affect some custom reporters.
 * - Projects from different shards are always kept as separate {@link TestProject} objects. E.g. if project
 *   'Desktop Chrome' was sharded across 5 machines then there will be 5 instances of projects with the same name in
 *   the config passed to
 *   [reporter.onBegin(config, suite)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter#reporter-on-begin).
