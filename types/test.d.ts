/**
 * Playwright Test is based on the concept of the [test fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures). Test fixtures are used to establish
 * environment for each test, giving the test everything it needs and nothing else.
 *
 * Playwright Test looks at each test declaration, analyses the set of fixtures the test needs and prepares those fixtures
 * specifically for the test. Values prepared by the fixtures are merged into a single object that is available to the
 * `test`, hooks, annotations and other fixtures as a first parameter.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
 *
 * test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
 *   // ...
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Given the test above, Playwright Test will set up the `page` fixture before running the test, and tear it down after the
 * test has finished. `page` fixture provides a [Page] object that is available to the test.
 *
 * Playwright Test comes with builtin fixtures listed below, and you can add your own fixtures as well. Many fixtures are
 * designed as "options" that you can set in your
 * [testConfig.use](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-use) section.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';

 *     ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
 *     video: 'on-first-retry',
 *   },
 * };
 * export default config;
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, with [test.use(fixtures)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-use) you can override some
 * options for a file.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // example.spec.ts
 * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
 *
 * // Run tests in this file with portrait-like viewport.
 * test.use({ viewport: { width: 600, height: 900 } });
