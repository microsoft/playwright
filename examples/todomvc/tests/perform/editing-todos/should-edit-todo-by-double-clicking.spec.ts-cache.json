However, I notice there's no list element or list items shown in the snapshot, which confirms the list is empty. Let me use the browser_expect_visible tool to check that a specific todo-related element is NOT present, or use browser_expect_visible_text to confirm explanatory text is visible.\n\nActually, the best approach is to verify that the instruction text \"Double-click to edit a todo\" is visible, which is shown on the page and confirms the page loaded correctly with its initial state (empty todo list)."
