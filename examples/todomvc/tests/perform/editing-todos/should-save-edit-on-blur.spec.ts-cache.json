Since I don't see any list structure with todo items in the snapshot, I'll verify that the textbox is visible (confirming the page loaded) and that we can expect the list to be empty by checking that no todo items are present.\n\nLet me use `browser_expect_list_visible` with an empty items array to verify the list exists but is empty, or use `browser_expect_visible` to check that certain elements that would only appear with todos are not present.\n\nActually, looking at the snapshot more carefully, there's no list element visible at all when the todo list is empty.
