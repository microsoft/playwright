## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain
This project is the **Playwright** testing and browser automation framework, primarily implemented in TypeScript with native bindings and integrations for Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, and Android devices. It enables **cross-browser web automation** for testing, scraping, and interaction scripting.

### Problem Solved
Playwright addresses the challenge of **reliable, cross-browser automation** by providing a unified API to control multiple browser engines, including headless and headed modes, with support for modern web features such as network interception, accessibility testing, and tracing.

### Target Users & Use Cases
- **Test engineers** writing end-to-end tests for web applications.
- **Developers** automating browser tasks or scraping.
- **QA teams** integrating automated UI tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Tooling developers** building on top of Playwright for custom automation or reporting.

### Core Business Logic & Domain Models
- **Browser abstraction**: Launching and controlling Chromium, Firefox, WebKit browsers.
- **Browser contexts**: Isolated sessions with cookies, storage, and permissions.
- **Pages and frames**: Represent browser tabs and iframes with DOM interaction.
- **Selectors and locators**: Robust element querying and interaction.
- **Network interception**: Request/response mocking and monitoring.
- **Tracing and recording**: Capturing detailed execution traces for debugging.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA tree snapshotting and accessibility testing.
- **Component testing**: Specialized support for React, Vue, Svelte components.
- **Android device automation**: Managing Android devices and WebViews.

## 4. Development Patterns and Standards

### Code Organization Principles
- **Modular Package Structure**: Each major feature or browser engine is encapsulated in its own package.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between client API, server logic, injected scripts, and component testing.
- **TypeScript Usage**: Strong typing with `.d.ts` files, interfaces, and type guards.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Extensive use of event emitters and listeners for asynchronous operations.
- **Factory and Proxy Patterns**: For object creation and protocol communication.
- **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies complex subsystems behind unified APIs.

### Testing Strategies and Coverage
- **Extensive Test Suites**: Located in `tests/` with cross-browser and cross-platform coverage.
- **Fixtures and Dependency Injection**: Used for test isolation and setup.
- **Snapshot Testing**: For UI and accessibility.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: WebSocket mocks, battery API mocks, network interception.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub workflows automate testing, building, and deployment.

### Error Handling and Logging
- **Custom Error Classes**: `TimeoutError`, `TargetClosedError`, `ProtocolError`.
- **Instrumentation and Logging**: `clientInstrumentation.ts`, `debugLogger.ts`.
- **Fail-Fast and Validation**: Environment checks, protocol validation, and strict error propagation.

### Configuration Management Patterns
- **Declarative Configs**: Playwright config files (`playwright.config.ts`), Vite configs.
- **Environment Variables**: Control debugging, platform overrides, and test modes.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime detection of platform, browser versions, and environment.

## 6. Usage and Operational Guidance

### Getting Started
- Use the **Playwright CLI** (`npx playwright`) to install browsers, run tests, and generate code.
- Configure tests via `playwright.config.ts` with options for browsers, devices, tracing, and retries.
- Use **Playwright Test** APIs (`test`, `expect`) for writing tests.
- For component testing, use dedicated packages (`playwright-ct-react`, `playwright-ct-vue`, etc.) with `defineConfig` and `mount` fixtures.

### Running Tests
- Tests are organized under `tests/` and can be run via CLI or CI workflows.
- Use environment variables to control test modes (e.g., `PWDEBUG`, `CI`).
- Leverage **network mocking**, **tracing**, and **accessibility snapshots** for advanced test scenarios.

### Extending and Modifying
- Add custom **selector engines** via `Selectors.register` in `packages/injected/src/selectorEngine.ts`.
- Extend **component testing** by registering components with `pwRegister`.
- Customize **browser launch options** and **context configurations** in `playwright.config.ts`.
- Modify or add **protocol dispatchers** in `packages/playwright-core/src/server/dispatchers` for new features.

### Debugging and Tracing
- Enable tracing via `context.tracing.start()` and analyze with `playwright show-trace`.
- Use **debug logs** and **instrumentation hooks** for detailed diagnostics.
- Utilize **recorder UI** (`RecorderApp`) for recording user actions and generating test code.

### Browser Installation and Environment Setup
- Use provided **platform-specific scripts** in `packages/playwright-core/bin` to install or update browsers.
- The installation process is automated during `npm install` in browser-specific packages.
- Environment detection utilities ensure compatibility and proper setup.
